# TextWorld

TextWorld is a game where you write down your actions and read the consequences.

## Setup

You wake up in the middle of a forest at night, with no idea how you got here. You're a freshman at Strangeland University, so maybe it's a prank from a few students.
It's up to you to decide what you do and where you go at this point.

## Choices

Your choices will lead you to follow a wide variety of intrigues. Be aware, because you can die depending on the choices you make.
